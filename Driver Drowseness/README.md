# Driver Drowseness
======
the code detect closed vs opened eyes using a webcam using [dlib library](http://dlib.net/)


the classifer used is an SVm classifer with an accurcay of 81% 

P.S:I'm not so sure about the accuracy hence the quality of the dataset is not that good (couldn't enhance it even applling multiple filters)

This the only Dataset i could find at the time of developing the code

# Usage 
======
you can install the program using the provided Cmake file
you will need to download [Dlib model](http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2)
to be able to run the program . 

notice this need you to have openCv installed in order to run it.
# P.S
=====
the code is a little rugh but i haven't found the time to clean it
